We encountered some issues while executing the Cloud Builder. The software packages on Azure failed, and the project team recommended reinstalling the failed components. Since Cloud Builder doesn’t allow selective installation, I had to wipe and reinstall everything.

To address the failures during installation, I used an iterative A/B testing approach. This helped us make some progress, and we now have the portal running successfully at:
https://googlr.com/portal/home

However, we’re facing an issue with the /server URI. It seems to be related to federation, but unfortunately, we have limited documentation to troubleshoot this.

I’ve reached out to the project team for support, and shiva has kindly set up a meeting to discuss the details of the issue.
