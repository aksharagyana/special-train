Ticket Title: Set up Azure Application Gateway with WAF for enhanced security

Description: We need to create an Azure Application Gateway with an integrated Web Application Firewall (WAF) to provide application-level protection against common web exploits. This will enhance the security of our applications hosted on Azure by preventing attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and others as defined by the OWASP top ten.

The Application Gateway with WAF should be configured with the appropriate settings for our environment, including URL-based routing, SSL termination, and appropriate WAF policies to ensure our application is protected from malicious attacks while maintaining performance.

Tasks:

Create an Azure Application Gateway with the WAF tier.
Configure URL-based routing rules as needed for our applications.
Enable SSL termination and import the SSL certificate for secure HTTPS traffic.
Set up the WAF policy to apply OWASP rules.
Set up custom rules if needed, based on application requirements.
Verify that the WAF is logging traffic and correctly blocking suspicious activities.
Test the Application Gateway and WAF integration.
